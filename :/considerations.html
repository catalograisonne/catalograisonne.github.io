    The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (widely abbreviated and cited as TLP) is
    the only book-length philosophical work by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig
    Wittgenstein that was published during his lifetime. It is recognized by
    philosophers as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century.
    The project had a broad goal: to identify the relationship between language
    and reality and to define the limits of science.[1] The work was originally
    published in German in 1921 as Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung
    (Logical-Philosophical Treatise). In 1922 it was published together with an
    English translation; the English text and that book bear the Latin title,
    which was suggested by G. E. Moore as homage to Baruch Spinoza's Tractatus
    Theologico-Politicus (1670).[2] Wittgenstein wrote the notes for the
    Tractatus while he was a soldier during World War I and completed it during
    a military leave in the summer of 1918.[3] The Tractatus was influential
    chiefly amongst the logical positivist philosophers of the Vienna Circle,
    such as Rudolf Carnap and Friedrich Waismann. Bertrand Russell's article
    "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" is presented as a working out of ideas
    that he had learned from Wittgenstein.[4] The Tractatus employs an austere
    and succinct literary style. The work contains almost no arguments as such,
    but rather consists of declarative statements, or passages, that are meant
    to be self-evident. The statements are hierarchically numbered, with seven
    basic propositions at the primary level (numbered 1â€“7), with each sub-level
    being a comment on or elaboration of the statement at the next higher level
    (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13). In all, the Tractatus comprises 525
    numbered statements. Wittgenstein's later works, notably the posthumously
    published Philosophical Investigations, criticised many of his earlier ideas
    in the Tractatus.
