        <p>
                Living and working in Detroit, MI. Their work occupies the space between words. A practice of time and space. Absence of object, everyday conversation. The insanity. Practice as force. Practice as surrender. Practice as applied in the studio of each moment.
                <br>
        <br>
A process of putting things away, permanent and temporary homes. A process of collection(verb). Objects, projects, notes, memories, moments, movements.  A search for new 'function's. New reasons to live. Collecting what is worthless and disregarding what is priceless. Inviting things beyond their usefulness. (taking outside of). Creation of new meaning. Movement through space. Through the house. Through conversation. The gutters (ruts) we create. The ways we can reimagine them. The spoon outside the kitchen. The peel after the orange. Receipts. Restructure the home. 
<br>
<br>

Iterative, connected, ongoing (non-ending). It builds over time (archive) and we take time to arrange it (where, with what, for how long). The music in the background, the breath (absence of breath). Collaborative. (How is anything not?) Inevitable. (How is anything not?) Sculptural. Contingent. Where is it being made? When is it being made? It can't be imported; it can't exported. If it doesn't want to get made, it doesn't. A response to Excess! The gaps in between. Circle economy. Maintenance Art.  Not how but only that.
